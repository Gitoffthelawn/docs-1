This is one procedure to audit the BleachBit's effectiveness.

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have the latest version of BleachBit. Preferably, it is
the latest version in Git or [the latest CI build](https://ci.bleachbit.org/).

### Google Chrome

#### Exercise

These steps "exercise" the browser to use all its functionality.

1. Start Google Chrome.
1. Enable Chrome Sync.
1. Go to Google Search, and search for a [string of random characters](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=8&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=off&format=plain&rnd=new). Make a note of this string for a step below.
1. On the [Evercookie](https://samy.pl/evercookie/) page, open the Chrome site preferences. Enable Flash, Location, and other site-specific preferences.
1. Create an Evercookie.
1. Download a file from any site, and make a note of the filename and download URL.
1. Run Service Workers ([demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/basic/)).
1. Play media ([demo](https://www.webmfiles.org/demo-files/)). (This is not equivalent to downloading the media.)
1. Use other functionality in Google Chrome, and make a note of the associated URLs or other strings.

#### Clean

1. Close Google Chrome.
1. Start BleachBit.
1. In the BleachBit preferences, enable the option *Overwrite contents*.
1. Use BleachBit to clean all of Google Chrome.

#### Audit

1. Use a tool such as `grep` to search the Google Chrome profile folder for the random string (used in Google Search, above), the site address `samy.pl`, and other strings from the exercise phase. There should be no matches.
1. Start Google Chrome.
1. Open the browser history (CTRL+H), and there should be none.
1. Revisit the Evercookie page, and the cookie with the same identifier should not be rediscovered.
