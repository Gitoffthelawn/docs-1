The general usage is as follows:

1.  Notice on the left of the main window is a list of cleaners and options. (Each cleaner has one or more options.)
2.  Click on the label of the cleaner that interests you. (The label is the text next to the checkbox.)
3.  Read the cleaner's description (which appears on the right).
4.  Check any options you want to clean.
5.  _Close any applications you will be cleaning._ For example, you should not clean Firefox while Firefox is running.
6.  Click the **Preview** button, and review the list of files. The preview button is "safe" and makes no changes to your system.
7.  Make any adjustments to your selection of options, and preview again until you are comfortable with the changes. Disable any options which you don't understand or make you uncomfortable.
8.  Click the **Delete** button.
