To install BleachBit, first <a href="https://www.bleachbit.org/download">download</a> the latest installation package for your system.

BleachBit is supported on Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, or 10 (32-bit or 64-bit).

Most Windows users want the standard installation. If you prefer to run in portably on a USB disk or on a system the administrators that prevents installation, use the portable installation.

#### Standard Installation

Run the installer which has a name like <tt>BleachBit-1.6-setup.exe</tt>. Then, follow the prompts.

Verify the installer is from a verified publisher (Andrew Ziem).

#### Silent Installation

Run the installer with the silent switch like this:

#### Portable Use

Do not double click on the <tt>.zip</tt> file.
