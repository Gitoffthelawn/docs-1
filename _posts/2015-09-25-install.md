### System requirements

#### Linux

### Windows
Most Windows users want the standard installation. If you prefer to run in portably on a USB disk or on a system the administrators that prevents installation, use the portable installation.

#### Windows: Silent Installation

Run the installer with the silent switch like this:

`BleachBit-1.6-setup.exe /S`

The switch _is_ case sensitive.

#### Windows: Portable Use

Download the package which has a name like <tt>BleachBit-1.6-portable.zip</tt>. Then use a standard unzip utility to unpackage the file. Such a utility is included with Windows: just right click on the <tt>.zip</tt> file and choose **Extract all files** which creates a new folder.

Do not double click on the <tt>.zip</tt> file.

### Ubuntu, Mint, and Debian

Double click on the downloaded installation package which has a name like <tt>bleachbit_1.6_all_ubuntu1404.deb</tt>. Then, follow the prompts.

Alternatively, install using the command line like this:

`sudo dpkg -i bleachbit_1.6_all_ubuntu1404.deb`

### Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, Mandriva

Double click on the downloaded installation package which has a name like <tt>bleachbit-1.4-1.1.fc20.noarch.rpm</tt>. Then, follow the prompts.

Alternatively, install using the command line like this:

`sudo rpm -Uvh bleachbit-1.4-1.1.fc20.noarch.rpm`

### Digital signatures

Windows executables are cryptographically signed using the standard Windows system and should look like this:

Also, the SHA256 sum of all released files is signed using [this public key](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/bleachbit_public.key). Look in the [SourceForge release directory](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bleachbit/files/bleachbit/) for files with the name like <tt>bleachbit-(version)-sha256sum.txt.asc</tt>.
